# ProPresenter7-Songbooks
If you want to import via the ProPresenter GUI Download the songbook that you want make sure it has TXT in the name, extract the songbook into a folder, then go into ProPresenter. Click file, New Library. Give it a name that will remind you of the songbook. After you add the library, click file once again hover over import, and click file. Go to the location you exported the files to and select all using the ctrl + A keys. This should allow you to import all the songs of your choice.
or you have another choice just download the ProPresenter zip file of the song book, and extract it into Documents\ProPresenter\Libraries\... And restart ProPresenter. That should show up in the left pane of propresenter window

Just a Forewarning. This was tested on the windows system. The first option should work for mac, the second one may need some digging. Also your performance on start of ProPresenter will be seriously impacted. I am not responsible for any damage caused to your device
